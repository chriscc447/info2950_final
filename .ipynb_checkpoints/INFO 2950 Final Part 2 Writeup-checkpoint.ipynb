    "Data description. This should be inspired by the format presented in Gebru et al, 2018. Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?__\n",
    "    * Observations-- songs\n",
    "    * Features -- song attributes (e.g., artist, title, streams), audio features (e.g., key, loudness, tempo)\n",
    "* __Why was this dataset created?__\n",
    "    * The reason this dataset was created was for the Top Charts on Spotify -- Top 200 or playlist with the most listened to songs.\n",
    "* __Who funded the creation of the dataset?__\n",
    "    * Spotify AB -- operates as a music streaming service company and offers digital music on media outlets such as computers, phones, and tablets\n",
    "* __What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?__\n",
    "    * Airplay - if a song is repeatedly played on the radio, most likely on the top charts. Tracked through Broadcast Data Systems (BDS) - to identify songs that are on radio and TV channels across the US\n",
    "    * Social Media/ Streaming - social interactions with Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. \n",
    "    * Album Sales - Nielsen SoundScan, an information system that tracks sales of music by scanning barcodes for such sources as online stores to concert sales. \n",
    "* __What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?__\n",
    "    * First, we scraped directly from Spotify's Top Charts website and got the top 200 songs on Spotify for a given date\n",
    "    * Next, we retrieved audio features for each song using Spotify’s API and rendered a complete dataset of songs with stream measures and audio features\n",
    "    * For our final dataset, we also removed songs that cannot be currently found on Spotify\n",
    "* __If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?__\n",
    "* Yes, people are aware of the data collection. The data was collected with Spotify, and they have a Terms and Conditions agreement which allows them to collect user data. The users expect the data to be used for personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data (hosted in a Cornell Google Drive or Cornell Box).__\n",
    "    * The scraped dataset can be found here (https://github.com/chriscc447/info2950_final); it is titled TopCharts_complete.csv\n",
    "    * It is also available in our Google Drive folder.\n",
    "    * The raw data is split into two parts. The first part is basic data about each song, and can be found on Spotify's Top Charts webpages (ex: https://spotifycharts.com/regional/us/daily/2020-03-22). The second part is the audio features for each song, and can be found by using the query feature that is accessible via the Spotify API."
